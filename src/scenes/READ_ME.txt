This folder contains scenes that are not necessarily levels. Such scenes can be like the-
main menu, the settings and the preload scene before the game starts.

Cutscenes will not be included in this folder despite it not being a fully playable level
because it technically is a portion of the game loop itself, and it will complicate 
stuff in terms of fetching their paths.
